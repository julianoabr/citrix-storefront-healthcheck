# Citrix Store Front Health Check #

Citrix StoreFront is an enterprise application store that provides an interface for users to access [XenDesktop](https://searchvirtualdesktop.techtarget.com/definition/Citrix-XenDesktop) and [XenApp](https://searchvirtualdesktop.techtarget.com/definition/Citrix-XenApp) virtual desktops and applications remotely.

StoreFront enables IT administrators to provide users with universal, self-service central access to their [virtual desktops](https://searchvirtualdesktop.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-desktop), applications and any associated data. StoreFront interacts with the [Citrix Receiver](https://searchvirtualdesktop.techtarget.com/definition/Citrix-Receiver) client software to support access to XenDesktop and XenApp servers from Windows, Mac, Apple iOS, Google Android, Linux and HTML5 endpoints.

Citrix's enterprise app store includes [single sign-on](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/single-sign-on?_gl=1*1k1v56b*_ga*MTM1NzA2MjYzMC4xNjE3MTAxNzk1*_ga_RRBYR9CGB9*MTYxODA2OTAwNi40LjAuMTYxODA2OTAwNi4w&_ga=2.177127149.979690428.1618069008-1357062630.1617101795) access to apps and desktops using the company's NetScaler Gateway access control management technology. StoreFront also contains security features such as [extensible authentication](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Extensible-Authentication-Protocol-EAP?_gl=1*22i4u0*_ga*MTM1NzA2MjYzMC4xNjE3MTAxNzk1*_ga_RRBYR9CGB9*MTYxODQwMzE3OC41LjAuMTYxODQwMzE4MS4w&_ga=2.220706128.979690428.1618069008-1357062630.1617101795) and smart card authentication.

StoreFront includes a [software developer's kit](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/software-developers-kit-SDK?_gl=1*17rrpg2*_ga*MTM1NzA2MjYzMC4xNjE3MTAxNzk1*_ga_RRBYR9CGB9*MTYxODQwMzE3OC41LjAuMTYxODQwMzE4MS4w&_ga=2.183081454.979690428.1618069008-1357062630.1617101795) that allows administrators to further customize the user display and app deployment, such as loading business-critical applications upon login. Administrators can use the Citrix Studio console to centrally manage StoreFront servers.


Citrix released StoreFront in XenDesktop and XenApp 7 as a replacement to the Web Interface feature, but StoreFront is compatible with versions as far back as XenDesktop and XenApp 5.5. StoreFront is also included in Citrix's [Workspace Suite](https://searchvirtualdesktop.techtarget.com/definition/Citrix-Workspace-Suite) and [Workspace Cloud](https://searchvirtualdesktop.techtarget.com/definition/Citrix-Workspace-Cloud) products.
